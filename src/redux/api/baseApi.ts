  reducerPath: "api" - This is the folder name where my reducers are stored. It serves as a unique identifier for this API slice within the Redux store.
  
  baseQuery - This base query function is used by each endpoint defined in the API. If no queryFn option is specified for an endpoint, it will use this base query function to make network requests. RTK Query provides fetchBaseQuery as a default base query function, which is a lightweight wrapper around fetch for common use-cases. However, in this case, we are using axiosBaseQuery to customize request and response handling using Axios.
